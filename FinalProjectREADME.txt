**Final Project**
There are 4 notebooks in this repo.
1 - ntxd.pcca.tpt.enhancedpath.ipy shows the markov state model used to determine the dominant transition pathways. Guess path frames are determined from the clustering and then a finite difference
method is used to maximize the number of frames in the guess path.

2 - pcv.alaninedipeptide.ipynb shows the calculation of several PCA and PC variables for alanine dipeptide simulations started at the transition state. Explains backround of method and provides documentation.

3 - PCV.ntail.xd_sparse_path_19frames.ipynb shows the calculation of tica,rmsd and Sa/Q based S,Z  path collective variables for the sparse frame set and shortened path.
 Also calculates the S,Z for for a tp trajectory at 300K.

4 - Calculates the same quatities as 3 but with an denser guess path. Also calculates the S,Z for for a tp trajectory at 300K.

data and input files for each system are stored in directories aladipeptide and ntxd
